# Security Considerations

## Authentication & Authorization

### User Authentication
- Supabase-based authentication system
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Separate user data and chat histories
- Admin retains full access to all user data
- Session management and token handling

### Plugin Security
- Sandboxed execution environment for plugins
- Permission-based plugin system via manifest files
- Resource usage limitations
- API access restrictions

## Data Security

### Storage
- Encrypted data at rest in Supabase
- Secure chat history isolation between users
- Vector storage security measures
- Regular backup procedures

### Communication
- Encrypted API communications
- Secure webhook handling
- Rate limiting on endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization

## Plugin Store Security

### Submission Process
- Code review requirements
- Automated security scanning
- Version control and signing
- Malware checking procedures

### Installation Safety
- Plugin verification system
- Dependency scanning
- Integrity checks during installation
- Update verification process

## Compliance & Privacy

### Data Handling
- GDPR compliance measures
- Data retention policies
- User data export capabilities
- Right to be forgotten implementation

### Audit & Monitoring
- Security event logging
- Access monitoring
- Plugin activity tracking
- Regular security audits
